## [[easy] challenge #286](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/55nior/20161003_challenge_286_easy_reverse_factorial/)
>Nearly everyone is familiar with the factorial operator in math. 5! yields 120 because factorial means "multiply successive terms where each are one less than the previous":

>5! -> 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 -> 120
>Simple enough.

>Now let's reverse it. Could you write a function that tells us that "120" is "5!"?

## How to build and run
You must have [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) installed and the binary in your path environment variable.
You must have the Microsoft linker installed.

The easiest way to get a hold of the Microsoft linker is by downloading Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE.

Once these are both reachable via command line, just run vbuild.ps1, then vrun.ps1.
